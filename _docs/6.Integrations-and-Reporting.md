# Integrations & Reporting

## External Integrations

LogViewer bridges the gap between monitoring and action by integrating directly with your issue tracking systems.

### Supported Platforms

- **Jira**
- **GitHub Issues**

### How it Works

1.  **Spot an Issue**: When viewing a log entry with an error or exception.
2.  **Push to Tracker**: Click the "Push to Tracker" button (available to Admin/Auditor roles).
3.  **One-Click Creation**: A modal appears pre-filled with the error message and context.
4.  **Issue Linked**: The log entry is preserved, and a corresponding issue is created in your tracker.

### Configuration

Configure your API keys and Project Repositories in the **Notification Hub** on the Dashboard.

## Automated Reporting

For stakeholders who don't visit the dashboard daily, LogViewer provides automated executive summaries.

### Executive Summary Report

A comprehensive HTML/PDF report offering a high-level view of system health.

**Content Includes:**

- **System Health Score**: Calculated based on storage usage and error rates.
- **Error Distribution**: Breakdown of logs by level (Error, Critical, Debug, etc.).
- **Top Recurring Issues**: The most frequent error messages.
- **Storage Stats**: Disk usage vs. quotas.
- **Audit Activity**: Recent administrative actions.

### Delivery Methods

- **On-Demand Download**: Administrators can generate and download the report anytime via the Dashboard.
- **Email Dispatch**: (Enterprise Only) Configure the "Email Report" trigger to send these summaries to a distribution list.

## Notification Hub

Centralized management for all your alert channels.

- **Channels**: Configure Slack Webhooks, Discord Webhooks, and Email SMTP settings.
- **Alert Levels**: Set the minimum log level (e.g., `Critical` or `Emergency`) that triggers an immediate notification.
- **Retention Policy**: Configure how long logs should be kept (e.g., 7, 30, 90 days) before automated cleanup.
