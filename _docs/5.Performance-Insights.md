# Performance Insights

LogViewer v1.0.0 moves beyond simple log display to providing actionable insights into your application's performance.

## Feature Overview

The **Performance Insights** module automatically analyzes your log entries to detect sluggish operations, bottlenecks, and resource exhaustion.

### 1. Slow Request Detection

LogViewer uses advanced Regex pattern matching to identify log entries that contain execution time metrics.

**Supported Patterns:**

- `Execution time: 500ms`
- `Query took: 1.2s`
- `Request processed in 350ms`

When a "slow" request (latency > 1s typically, or configurable thresholds) is detected:

- **Visual Highlighting**: The latency metric is badge-highlighted in Amber/Red within the log details.
- **Hotspot Tracking**: The entry is indexed for the Performance Hotspots widget.
- **Trend Correlation**: It is plotted against traffic volume in the Dashboard Trend Chart.

### 2. Performance Hotspots Widget

Located on the Dashboard, this widget ranks the top 5 slowest operations across your recent logs.

- **Purpose**: Quickly identify which specific routes, queries, or jobs are dragging down system performance.
- **Columns**: Operation Name (e.g., `GET /api/users`), Latency (e.g., `1540ms`), and Occurrence Time.

### 3. Traffic vs. Latency Correlation

The main Dashboard Trend Chart now includes a secondary dataset for **Slow Requests** (dotted orange line) overlaid on **Total Traffic** (solid blue area).

- **Insight**: This allows you to instantly see if error spikes or system load correlates with performance degradation.
- **Interactive**: Clicking on a peak in the Slow Requests line will filter the log view to that specific date and performance context.

## Best Practices

- **Structured Logging**: Ensure your application logs execution time for critical operations. Use standard formats like "Task X took 50ms" for best auto-detection.
- **Regular Review**: Check the Hotspots widget daily to spot creeping performance regressions before they affect users.
